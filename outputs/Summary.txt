Hello.If you're like, most students, you probably have some anxiety about calculus one and think it's a difficult or hard topics to understand and what I'm going to tell you today and show you here in a few minutes is that everything in calculus one makes total sense.And it's actually very, very simple to understand if you just take everything and step by step increments.So watch this clip here for a few minutes here and you'll be wondering why you thought it was so difficult to begin with now before we actually tackle any calculus, it's really important to review some things that you already know because calculus is a natural extension of algebra.So here's a graph.Everybody should have seen a graph of the line somewhere along in algebra one.Now, this is a relatively shallow line.Right, So we began in algebra to talk about the slope of the line.And you should have learned that a long time ago.So this guy is on the low side.So I'll draw another set of X. Y, directly underneath here.Right.And here we'll draw a different line, will draw a very steep line, right?Something that's very steep, like a steep mountain.And so what we learn here again, as we can calculate slope, which typically we call it, you know, m fer slope.We talked about that a lot in algebra, and so in this case we do the same thing.Now.This is very essential to calculus, you'll see why in just a second.And when you do this calculation, since it's rise divided by run, this guy rises a lot so it's slope is going to be higher.All right now, let's move away from the algebra topics a little bit and start to tie in a little bit of the calculus.In fact this is very common.The real world is always curved.So it's impossible if you're trying to look at the slope of something to just limit yourself to lines.And so now we begin to talk about calculus and you'll see why that comes into play here, basically what we want to do is figure out how steep or what the slope of this curve is.But you might ask yourself how could we possibly find out what the steepness of this curve is when it's constantly changing.Notice the slope of this guy up here at the top is very steep.Right?Obviously it's changing as you go along the curve.So how do you define the slope of this curve?You can't describe the slope of the whole thing at once because it's constantly changing.But let's say this part at this moment in time, it's the part we want to know how how steep it is.Well, there's, I should say the slope of it, there's a couple of ways to think about it.The easiest way graphically, as you could actually take a couple of points, you could start, this is the point you're interested in.Maybe I pick one here and now I'll draw a line through these two points like that, the green line.So for the punch line here, let me, instead of cluttering up this graph, let me draw you another one below and let me just kind of redraw everything.And that way we're all on the same page.So here is my curve again and again.I'm interested me use my red here.And we have a very special name for this concept in calculus one and that is called the derivative.So this is the number one most important concept in all of calculus and everything you'll possibly ever learn in calculus.You have just learned the fundamental thing about it that sets it apart and makes it important and that is the derivative of any point along.In fact, you typically take about half of calculus one to understand what the derivative is and how you calculate it and how to do all of the math behind it.Now, for the rest of Calculus one or at least a good chunk of it, we basically uh learn how to do this calculation of the derivative without drawing graphs.But before I get there, I want to give you a couple more examples just to show you what if you had a crazy graph that looks something like this.And somebody asked you what is the derivative of this curve at that red point right there.Now it sounds very hard when you don't know anything about calculus because you're like, what is a derivative?Me that seems complicated.In other words, it just barely kisses that curve at that exact point right there.Right.
